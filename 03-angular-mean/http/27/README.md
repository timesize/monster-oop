| Objectives |
| :--- |
| Make API requests with `$http`. |
| When a form is submitted, send data from its input fields in a request. |
| Send query string parameters with requests. |

## Angular `$http`


We **should** know jQuery's `$.ajax` by now.

<details>
  <summary>What does this method do?</summary>

  > It makes HTTP calls asynchronously from our browser and allows us to request information over HTTP without interrupting the front-end or causing page reloads.
</details>

In our projects, we've used this method often, and we've seen the `$.get` and `$.post` shorthand versions. Angular has a stand-in for `$.ajax` called `$http`.

`$http` is an Angular service.


We can use `$http` from directly within a controller, so we'll try that to get started. When we talk more about services, we'll look at another option.


### Echo App

The popular front-end code sharing website jsfiddle has an "echo" api that responds with information about the requests it gets. This simple [Echo App](https://jsfiddle.net/9L7wae3g/) uses the echo api to show off Angular's `$http`.  You should be able to answer these questions. If not, ask!

* Where is `echoApp` defined?
* What is the name of the `ng-app` used on this page?
* Where is `EchoController` defined?
* What is the name of the `ng-controller` used on the page?
* How did we inject (include) required libraries for a controller?
* How did we make a GET request to an API?
* How did we set the API endpoint URL?
* How did we send query parameters to the API?
* How did we send data to the API?
* Where is the success callback defined?
* Where is the error callback defined?
* How do we set `results` to be the response from an API?

## CRUD operations with `$http`

Here are a few examples of how we'd use `$http` to access an API that describes a man named Jon Snow and his projects. Let's assume the base URL is `http://www.jonsnow-portfolio.com`, and that Jon has his site configured to allow cross-origin requests. (Just like with `$.ajax`, we can leave this part out when we're serving our front-end from the same computer as our back-end.)

  </details>

</details>

<details><summary>**In Angular, how do we get form data when it's submitted and serialize it?**  Getting the data is a simple application of `ng-model`, with an object waiting in the controller to track form data. To enable submit, we'll need a submit button inside the form, an `ng-submit` attribute in the form tag, and a function in the controller to handle the submit event. Click for sample code!</summary>

 
  ```html
  <!-- html -->
  <form ng-submit="projectCtrl.createProject();">
    <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="project type" ng-model="projectCtrl.newProject.type"></textarea>
    <!-- other inputs here -->
    <input type="submit">
  </form>
  ```
  
  ```js
  // inside ProjectController
  vm.createProject = function(){
    console.log('creating project!');
    // make the http request!
    // remember to use the data you have from two-way binding
  }
  ```

## Your Turn

We've gone over how to build forms and work with remote servers using Angular. Now it is your turn to connect an angular front-end to an API.
